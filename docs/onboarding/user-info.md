# User info

Here we can fill personal user info.
We are getting user object form Store and if user has some information - we autofill.

Available fields to change in this section:


- First Name: `firstName: string`

- Last Name: `lastName: string`

- Business Name: `companyName: string`

- Business Type: `businessTypes: number[]`.
As element of the array we send id of chosen business type. At this moment it is single select.
We get list of available business types:
```
GET /v1/business-types
```
Expected output:

```
[
    {
        id: number
        name: string
    },
]
```

- Phone number: `phone: string`

- Acceptance of terms and conditions: `acceptTerms: boolean`

- Address: `address: string`

- Zip: `zip: string | number`

- State: `state: string`

- City: `city: string`

For filling in State, Zip and City on the front end side we use here.maps api for autocomplete input.

On "Save" we send request to 

```
PUT /v1/users/${userId}
```

In params we send whole user object. 

Expected output - updated user object. We save it to Store.
