###### My Profile

My profile section could be reached from two places in portal: Side nav panel and top right Account Icon.

My profile Section has four main sections.

- Business Type: `businessTypes: number[]`.
As element of the array we send id of chosen business type. At this moment it is single select.
We get list of available business types:
```
GET /v1/business-types
```

        id: number
        name: string

On "Save" we send request to 

```
PUT /v1/users/${userId}
```

In params we send whole user object. 

Expected output - updated user object. We save it to Store.

#### Change Password
In this section we also can **Change Password**. On click - the new modal with fields will open.

The current password is required.

The route for change of password:

```
POST /v1/users/${id}/changePassword
```

As parameter we send: 
```
oldPassword: "11111111"
newPassword: "12345678"
```

New password must be at least 8 characters long.

Expected output:

```
{
  password_changed: [true]
}
```


## Subscription
At the real begining we are sending two requests to obtain information about user's subscription.

1) Does user has any saved credit cards

```
GET /v1/users/${userID}/cards
```

Expected output:

```
[
  {
    brand: "visa"
    country: "US"
    expMonth: 4
    expYear: 2024
    last4: "4242"
    paymentMethodId: "pm_1HJg1xDTu2PET25E8Z8oOxpE"
    threeDS: true
  }
]
```

2) Information about current user subscription

```
GET /v1/stripe/subscription
```

Expected output:

200:

```
{
  canceledAt: null
  created: "2020-12-01T12:46:21+00:00"
  currentPeriodEnd: "2021-04-01T12:46:21+00:00"
  currentPeriodStart: "2021-03-01T12:46:21+00:00"
  endedAt: null
  expiresAt: null
  plan: {
    id: "membership_monthly"
    nickname: "Monthly Membership"
  }
  status: "active" | "expires"
  trialEnd: null
  trialStart: null
}
```

**OR**

403: 

```
{
  security: ["Action is denied!"]
}

```

Expected output 200 - subscription objects with property `status: 'expires'`.

Please note - we can use current subscription with status **expires** till the end of the current period.

We can also reactivate subscription.

If subscription ended - we will get 403. We still have an oppoptrunitey to activate subbscription, but we will not be able to use paid functions unless we do it.

#### Cancelation


If the status of the subscription is **active** - we can cancel subscription:

```
DELETE /v1/stripe/subscription/cancel
```


#### Activation


If the status of the subscription is **expires** or we get 403 - we can activate subscription.


On user subscription, it is required to provide plan slug or ID to which Plan user is willin to opt in:

```
POST /v1/stripe/subscribe

```

Request JSON body:

```
{
    paymentMethodId?: "pm_xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    plan: "my-plan-slug"
    code?: "my-promo-code"
}
```

If there is `code` param - `paymentMethodId` is not required and the other way around.

Expected output: 

```
{
  plan: { <wholePlanObject>}
  subscription: {
    status: "active"
  }
}
```

**NOTE**  If there is no credit card saved - we first need to save credit card and get its `paymentMethodId`:

We do so useing stripe plugin inner function:

```
POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_methods
```

We do not send request to get available plant for the user - we are getting it form Store. On login we recieve available plans and save them to Store.

## Logo

Logo edition - is a separated modal.

When we upload a new logo image we send binary images to:

```
POST /v1/upload/users/${userId}/logo
```

Request JSON body:

```
{
    image: (binary)
    original: (binary)
}
```

Expected output: 

```
{
  imageUrl: "https://winlocal-stage-client-panel.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/users/555/logo/be0d759ed5addaebc8cb4e7fdae73e88c69d2d7a.png"
}
```
