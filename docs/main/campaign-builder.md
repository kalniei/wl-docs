# Campaign Builder

Campaign builder is a place where you can create OR edit campaign.

## Add Campaign

At this moment there are three available campaigns in this view: Find, Social and Email.
Though we first check if permissions are allowing to add any of theese camapigns.

Please note - if permissions are allowing to add Find campaign and additional Find campaign - we will check if user already has one or two campaign and then either show the button with Find Campaign or not. If user has multiple Find campaign permission - we will always show Find campaign in Campaign Builder.

At the side navigation pannel we can see all the steps that are required for chosen type of the campaign.

We CAN NOT navigate through them, though there is an option to go forward and backword inside each step.

**NOTE** We can not add PYL ( Push Your Limits ) campaign inside campaign builder. We have separated position in side navigation to do so.

## Edit Campaign

On edit campaign we enter campaign builder with no opportunity to change the type of this campaign. 

At the side navigation pannel we can see all the steps that are required for chosen type of the campaign.
